# Drive On: Raspberry Pi Self-Driving Car Project - CSC 615 Final Project

Welcome to the "Drive On" repository – the hub of our CSC 615 final project showcasing an innovative miniature self-driving car powered by the Raspberry Pi 4. This project is a collaborative effort, highlighting our expertise in both hardware assembly and software development.

## Project Highlights

- **Hardware Assembly:** Meticulously assembled from the ground up, incorporating the latest Raspberry Pi technology.

- **Autonomous Navigation:** Utilizing line sensors, our self-driving car confidently maneuvers through diverse courses, demonstrating its precision in following predefined paths.

- **Obstacle Avoidance:** Safety is paramount! Our car is equipped with infrared sensors, intelligently detecting and avoiding obstacles during its autonomous journey.

## Technical Details

- **Programming Language:** C

- **GPIO Library and Direct-Memory Access:** Extensive use of GPIO library functions and direct-memory access to program custom functions manipulating sensor I/O readings.

- **Main Function:** The core functionalities for running the self-driving car are implemented in "main.c."

- **Compilation and Execution:** The Makefile simplifies the build process, making it easy to compile and execute the code.

- **Linux Expertise:** Operating the Raspberry Pi required a strong understanding of Linux, a skillset fundamental to the successful execution of our project.
