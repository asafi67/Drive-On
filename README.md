##Raspberry Pi Self-Driving Car Project

Welcome to the "Drive On" repository – home to an exciting CSC 615 final project! In collaboration with my team, we embarked on the journey of creating a miniature self-driving car powered by the Raspberry Pi 4. This project showcases our skills in both hardware assembly and software development.
Project Highlights

    Hardware Assembly: We meticulously assembled the car from the ground up, incorporating the latest Raspberry Pi technology.

    Autonomous Navigation: Leveraging line sensors, our self-driving car confidently maneuvers through diverse courses, showcasing its ability to follow predefined paths with precision.

    Obstacle Avoidance: Safety is paramount! Our car is equipped with infrared sensors, enabling it to intelligently detect and avoid obstacles during its autonomous journey.

Technical Details

    Programming Language: C

    GPIO Library and Direct-Memory Access: The project involved extensive use of the GPIO library functions and direct-memory access to program custom functions that manipulate sensor I/O readings.

    Main Function: The heart of the project lies in "main.c," where the core functionalities for running the self-driving car are implemented.

    Compilation and Execution: The Makefile simplifies the build process, making it easy to compile and execute the code.

    Linux Expertise: Operating the Raspberry Pi required a strong understanding of Linux, a skillset that played a fundamental role in the successful execution of our project.

How to Use

    Clone this repository to your local machine.
    Navigate to the project directory and compile using the provided Makefile.
    Execute the program to witness the Raspberry Pi-powered self-driving car in action.
